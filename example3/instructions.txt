Mongodb Instructions - Node101


Setting it all up: 

1. 	Start up the terminal. Change directory to your project directory.

2. 	Create a directory to house your MongoDB. 

3. 	Use the following command to start a mongodb server
	
		$ mongod --dbpath /path/to/dbfolder

4. 	Fire up another terminal.

5. 	Use the following command to connect to the mongodb server to insert and view data.

		$ mongo

6. 	Yay! You've connected to the mongodb server and now have access to the mongo terminal.


Creating a Database:

1.	Creating a database is as simple as following command.

		> use exampleDb
   
	Note: The db won't get instantiated until you add some data into it. =)


Creating a Collection:  

1.	Just like a database, a collection is created only when the first data value is inserted into the collection.

2.	To insert into a collection (thereby creating it), use the following command

		> db.<collectionName>.insert(<data>)

	For example, if I want to create a "user" collection, 

		> db.user.insert( { "name" : "John Doe", "age" : "23" });

3. 	To view all the records in a collection, use the following command

		> db.<collectionName>.find();

	It can get a little messy when you have a lot of data in each record. The fix for this? Try this. =)

		> db.<collectionName>.find().pretty();

4.	To delete an entire collection, use
	
		> db.<collectionName>.drop();
